# SmaDS_SiamUnet

Code for our multi-sensor change detection paper\

Change detection (CD) methods for remote sensing images based on deep learning have garnered increasing research attention. However, existing deep learning approaches are often tailored for specific types of sensors. Extending these methods to dual-sensor scenarios presents challenges, including difficulties in data fusion and an increase in parameter numbers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-stream encoder-decoder CD network architecture.

We compared SmaDS-SiamUnet with the following baselines: FC-EF, SiamUnet-conc-multi, SiamUnet-conc, SiamUnet-multi-Four, and SiamUnetmulti-Fourfusion.
